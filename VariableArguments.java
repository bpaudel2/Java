   /* FINALIZE METHOD
    * It is possible to define a method that will be called just before an object's 
    * final destruction by the garbage collector. This method is called finalize( ), 
    * and it can be used to ensure that an object terminates cleanly.For example, 
    * you might use finalize( ) to make sure that an open file owned by that object is 
    * closed.
    * To add a finalizer to a class, you simply define the finalize( ) method. 
    * The Java runtime calls that method whenever it is about to recycle an object of 
    * that class.
    * Inside the finalize( ) method, you will specify those actions that must be 
    * performed before an object is destroyed.

        The finalize( ) method has this general form âˆ’

        protected void finalize( ) {
        // finalization code here
        }
